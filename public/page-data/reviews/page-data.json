It’s only been 3 week and it has been the best purchase I’ve ever made so far. The classes/instructors are incredible. The bike is beautifully made (bike itself is super quiet) while riding) and the customer service with stryde is Top notch. They will get back to your really quickly with any questions and you can tell they really want to help how ever they can! I highly recommend this bike and bike subscription. \nThe stryde bike is the perfect set up for a momma like me. I have 3 young kids at home then with being stuck at home in recent months due to pandemic &amp; a having a immunocompromised child, I could not figure out how I would be able to get out to work out which was important and so needed for both my physical and mental health. The stryde bike was my answer and I’m so happy with my purchase.

I enjoy the stryde app because it allows me to ride with my local spin studio since I can not be there in person. The price point was a huge plus. I was also attracted to the unlocked tablet and the SPD clip style.\n\nPROS: Easy setup, tablet worked immediately out of the box. The bike itself is dense and quality, I am not afraid to ride hard. The tablet is large and extremely easy to use, plus, you can open other content in the browser—the tablet seamlessly connected to my earbuds without issue. The seat is comfortable and easy to adjust. I find that I am achieving the same workout using my stryde as I was in the studio.\n\nCONS: I wish I could slide the handlebar setup horizontally toward the seat. When I put my bike together, the neck of the handlebar setup is slightly off-center, and it appears that it was manufactured this way. The offset handlebars do not interfere with my workout and are more of an aesthetic blemish. I do wish that if I accidentally exited a class, I could just resume it where it closed.\n\nAll-in-all, I am pleased with my purchase. There were some shipping difficulties (which was expected due to the climate of things); The stryde team updated me every step of the way! It showed their care and concern for their customers. I am glad I went with stryde, between the content, price, and high-quality customer service, you will not be disappointed."},{"productIdentifier":"4360010170448","score":5,"updatedAt":"2021-07-16T04:39:33.000Z","createdAt":"2020-07-01T14:45:33.000Z","sentiment":0.590507,"votesUp":0,"votesDown":0,"title":"My reasons behind the purchase","name":"Christine S.","email":"chsuda1@gmail.com","reviewerType":"verified_buyer","content":"My reasons behind the purchase of the bike were; site indicated a two day delivery vs. other bikes at 60 days, no commitment to subscription services and cost.

My only critique would be the spin studios. Some of their audio needs improvement. There are classes where you can hear the instructor well and the music sounds very low in the background. Music in spin is very motivating so having the right volume for Instructions and music is imperative. I also have difficulty at times discerning some of their instructions. I’m in PA and have attended spin classes for 11 years. The terminology seems different depending upon the area it seems. Overall as I stated previously, the bike is superior. Hopefully more apps and options are added in the future."},{"productIdentifier":"4360010170448","score":5,"updatedAt":"2020-09-16T17:22:56.000Z","createdAt":"2020-09-16T17:19:54.000Z","sentiment":0.991849,"votesUp":0,"votesDown":0,"title":"Great customer service.

I guess the advantage to Peloton is all the instructors are using the same equipment so instructions are pretty seamless, but still, I’m not sure its worth another grand to have the exact same specs.

I suggest two people because of the weight of the bike and balance.\nNotes on the classes-I noticed that there now is only one studio that has new classes, and I find that disappointing. Classes show up in order of newest first, so the other studios are pushed way to the bottom.

Turning it off and rebooting cures the problem. The tablet is extraordinarily slow to respond. If split screen is used, the icons of the Stryde app overlap and it’s hard to select the desired one. I’m hoping the picture-in-picture mode, when available, will alleviate this problem. I nevertheless enjoy the bike, use it frequently, and would recommend it.

I did a lots of research on bikes prior to the purchase as there things I wanted on the bike which were very important. My daughter was researching as well for herself and found the bike and she purchased one as well. The Stryde bike had close to all the things I wanted and this is why I chose it. \n The saddle post has the silver piece sticking out far under the saddle which is something I believe Stryde is working on. The bike will be a great training tool and will help improve my outdoor cycling. The tablet and software have been disappointing. Customer Service has been great with trying to resolve issues. I&#x27;ve had the bike over a month and I&#x27;m still experiencing problems with the tablet such as it will rotate if I open certain apps (apps recommended by Stryde) and fuzziness on the Peloton app. This has been frustrating. \nBecause my training is important to me, I want my metrics in front of me. The PIP is very good as it shows cadence, resistance and output. It would be great to see my heart rate displayed on the screen also. Another really great addition would be mileage to be included in the metrics. \nThe last thing I&#x27;d like to add is the importance of knowledge for instructors. I taught spinning for over 15 years. Safety is so important. The few instructors I tried did not appear knowledgeable in indoor cycling instruction. There were many things being done which either were extremely unsafe for the riders or had absolutely no benefit. This is concerning because there are many folks new to cycling (per the Stryde FaceBook page) and they could easily get injured. \nI am cancelling my Stryde app because I won&#x27;t do these classes for the reasons mentioned but I have the Peloton app and can do online videos as well. \nOverall I am very happy with the bike itself and the Customer Service. I&#x27;ve ridden many indoor cycling bikes and have an original Spinning bike (about 25 years old) and the Styde bike itself is very good. When the new saddle post is re-designed I would like to have mine replaced. One other suggestion would be to have more space between the tablet and the bottle cages so it is easier to grab the water bottles. Or the ability to raise the tablet to allow for more space. This is a minor issue. \nThanks for the outstanding Customer Service!\nGina"},{"productIdentifier":"4360010170448","score":5,"updatedAt":"2020-12-26T19:39:36.000Z","createdAt":"2020-12-26T19:32:18.000Z","sentiment":0.990982,"votesUp":0,"votesDown":0,"title":"Timely delivery with good communication.","name":"Erica G.","email":"dizzyer6@hotmail.com","reviewerType":"verified_buyer","content":"Timely delivery with good communication.

I ordered it in November, and it took one week to arrive, which was amazing compared to the long order times at other companies. The setup was easy -- the bike was really heavy, but my husband was able to drag it up our stairs, and then we set the rest of it up in about 30 minutes together. I have both the Styde app and the Peloton app, which I learned how to download via a YouTube video. On the Stryde app, my favorite studio is High Ride Cycle because it has fun choreography. I mostly use the Peloton app though, with the Stryde app minimized in the corner so I can monitor cadence, etc. \n\nI have a couple of complaints: The Stryde app is a little buggy. If you pause a ride, you lose all your stats and it won&#x27;t log the ride. You can also only choose white avatars, and not a lot of women, which doesn&#x27;t feel very inclusive. Why not just let us upload our photos, Stryde? I prefer the Peloton app because each ride has more details: the play list, etc, which I find helpful when I&#x27;m feeling unmotivated to ride. Like, &quot;Oh, I like all these songs, so this will be a fun ride.&quot; Also the Stryde app doesn&#x27;t update very often -- the main screen has had the same Fergie ride with a November 2020 date for a week or so now, and it&#x27;s nearly January, and the classes have very few details of what songs you&#x27;ll be working out to and what kind of class you&#x27;re doing. On the bike itself, there is also kind of a weird adjustment lever near the seat that was hitting me awkwardly, which I was able to unscrew and remove and it solved that issue. \n\nOverall, though, I REALLY like this bike. The ride is smooth. (I&#x27;ve never ridden a Peloton bike, so I can&#x27;t compare to that, but I have taken a handful of SoulCycle classes and this bike doesn&#x27;t feel any different to me.) My mental health is much improved now that I am getting regular cardio. I think it looks nice enough in my house. It was literally $1000 less than a Peloton bike! I was able to buy bike shoes at a local shop and they installed the clips that came with the bike, but I used my normal gym shoes for the first month without issue. The Peloton app works just fine (app users don&#x27;t get nearly as many stats, but it&#x27;s 1/3 the price per month), and the Stryde app has some really fun classes (shout out to Alissa Benson at High Ride Cycle in Denver!). \n\nOverall, I am really happy I bought a Stryde bike. Once the coronavirus is over, I anticipate returning to my Pilates studio, and this bike becoming just one facet of my workout routine instead of the bulk of my workout routine. So I really love that the app is optional as my needs change. I wasn&#x27;t a spinner before, but now I&#x27;m into it and use it at least 4 times a week."},{"productIdentifier":"4360010170448","score":4,"updatedAt":"2020-12-31T15:32:35.000Z","createdAt":"2020-12-31T15:28:09.000Z","sentiment":0.551821,"votesUp":0,"votesDown":0,"title":"The bike is good.

It’s crazy sturdy, looks sleek with its matte black finish, it’s so very smooth and the best part: I can do any workout vid on any platform and the cadence resistance output meter in the small mode in the corner stays on top when I do workouts so I have all the freedom to cycle with the p word cult and still have my stats show. I can push myself and keep on track with any classes. I love this bike my husband loves this bike and I’m 5’2” and he’s 6’3” so it has some range in adjustments. Let me also not forget the amazing customer service, this thing showed up on my doorstep so quick within weeks of ordering and anytime I’ve had a single question even at 1030p PST I’ve gotten a personal email from a person not an automated message within ten minutes.

If I had it to do over I’d spend the extra on Peloton. Unfortunately I found out after the fact that I would have needed the original box to return and this was too heavy for me to move without cutting open a lot of the box. The issues I’ve experienced are the seat post slips a lot. I can usually get it tight enough to only slip a quarter inch during my ride but overnight it creeps 3-4 inches back down again. The tablet and audio are also not great. I find that wearing headphones helps that, but I’d rather not have to wear them. There also seems to be a significant lag on the screen for the resistance. The tablet setup is also not user friendly at all. I do find that the stryde app classes are great so I feel like I get a good workout in, but the annoying little things do add up.

And the joints/screws/ connections/finishes:materials all still seem pretty solid and well intact. Clipping the shoes in took some getting used to and I had to slightly loosen the adjustment in the pedal to get clipped in. \n\nThe tablet was a bit buggy for me in terms of connecting to internet but I found (through screwing through a lot of settings) that it was due to an obscure setting in my mesh router system for ipv6 pass through. Now it works full time, mostly with occasional drop due to Bluetooth and 2.4 Wi-Fi signals interfering with one another. Having to use my mobile hotspot long term would not be an option.\n\nI’m a bigger guy (6’ 3”- 280lbs) and It’s pretty sturdy. Not a lot of wobbling or nervous rocking. I Wish there was just a bit more vertical room in the handle bars, ability to pull them closer, and seat for better ergonomics/comfort. This would go a long way in the more active in and out of the saddle/core engagement classes. \n\nCustomer support is great and responsive and you can tell they try to address your issue. Even if there’s not an immediate resolution. \n\nI haven’t really tried using too many other apps yet (peloton, if it, etc) but the support for getting those up and running seems to be there based on the Facebook group and customer service responsiveness. \n\nThe stryde classes are pretty good overall. A few more filters for options would be nice and tagging some of the classes as beginner/intermediate/advanced or calorie burn/fat burn/endurance etc would be helpful. Would also like more guidance on what to expect in rhythm, rides vs beginner vs low impact vs more advanced classes. The instructors are energetic and there are quite a few to pick from. Plenty of music genres to pick from (although selfishly I’d like more hip hop/r and b choices). classes are added pretty frequently so the library is pretty well built so far. \n\nThe delivery time was great. Less than two weeks vs 10+ weeks for some of the competitors."},{"productIdentifier":"4360010170448","score":5,"updatedAt":"2021-03-09T11:58:24.000Z","createdAt":"2021-03-09T11:46:01.000Z","sentiment":0.971563,"votesUp":0,"votesDown":0,"title":"I’ve always been into fitness-","name":"Marcy L.","email":"marchella.l33@gmail.com","reviewerType":"verified_buyer","content":"I’ve always been into fitness- I use to be a trainer myself- this was the best purchase I could have done for myself - this year we found out my husband has stage 3 melanoma and during treatments and surgeries I was not taking care of myself and I have my own auto immune that really can flair up- during these times I was finding it harder and harder to take time for myself and get my endorphins going - I splurged and bought the bike and haven’t looked back- I love it - best thing I have done for myself in a long time- the classes are great the music is awesome there is such a variety - best thing I could have done !"},{"productIdentifier":"4360010170448","score":5,"updatedAt":"2021-03-09T21:17:56.000Z","createdAt":"2021-03-09T21:14:08.000Z","sentiment":0.984919,"votesUp":0,"votesDown":0,"title":"I’m falling in love with","name":"Tereasa O.","email":"winoboogie@outlook.com","reviewerType":"verified_buyer","content":"I’m falling in love with my bike!

I wish there had been digital assembly videos sent prior to receiving the bike with info on something as simple as how to open the box since the manual inside mentions this but it’s a little too late. Plus videos on proper seat height, depth, etc for individual riders. Assembly was relatively easy and the bike feels super solid and secure. We have been taking advantage of the “Free Ride” option while utilizing Peloton app content which has been great! Our daughter prefers to watch something on YouTube so the flexibility of the open interface is awesome and a major selling point for us! Having 2 sided peddles is helpful for new bikers too, allowing my wife and I to decide how much we ride the bike before investing in a pair of clip-in cycling shoes. Hopefully the “Free Ride” option will connect with an Apple Watch in the future to help track heartbeat and exercise. We can connect our AirPods which is helpful when others are in the room. Overall, the bike looks great, has a relatively small foot print and has been great for our exercise routine, just wish we had bought it earlier in the winter!"},{"productIdentifier":"4360010170448","score":5,"updatedAt":"2021-04-13T10:50:08.000Z","createdAt":"2021-04-13T10:42:42.000Z","sentiment":0.963742,"votesUp":0,"votesDown":0,"title":"Best purchase ever!!","name":"James E.","email":"tiffanygeer27@gmail.com","reviewerType":"verified_buyer","content":"Best purchase ever!!"},{"productIdentifier":"4360010170448","score":5,"updatedAt":"2021-04-13T13:41:37.000Z","createdAt":"2021-04-13T13:27:20.000Z","sentiment":0.99355,"votesUp":0,"votesDown":0,"title":"I am loving my Stryde","name":"Andrea A.","email":"andreababrams@gmail.com","reviewerType":"verified_buyer","content":"I am loving my Stryde bike!

We love the bike and we love the app. We particularly love the High Ride classes! The bummer is receiving the bike was awful. We got no notification it was arriving. They rescheduled multiple times and missed deliveries multiple times. I spent hours on hold trying to figure out where the bike was. Stryde customer support while very prompt was not able to do anything, they just sent emails to the last mile logistics company. After the 4th day of waiting around my house being promised the bike was on its way just drove to the logistics center and got it myself. They were pretty surprised. I read reviews of this logistics company and it seems like a very common experience. As a business you own the experience your vendors provide, I would urge you to find a logistics company that matches the quality of your bikes and classes. I would have paid more to have it delivered promptly and when promised. \n\nChris"},{"productIdentifier":"4360010170448","score":5,"updatedAt":"2021-05-14T12:43:58.000Z","createdAt":"2021-05-14T12:40:53.000Z","sentiment":0.966774,"votesUp":0,"votesDown":0,"title":"I love my bike.

Either following a virtual bike ride on you tube or watching news on TV.. I always use the &quot;free ride&quot; on the tablet to keep my cadence, time, output and distance at hand. I am waiting for someone to come up with an update, app or other means to track progress during the free ride. So far, I have gotten used to the seat and am comfortable with loading apps and operating the tablet. No issues with the bike operation or construction, it seems very well built. I plan on purchasing some riding shoes and eventually using instructors either via Stryde or Pelaton subscription."}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}

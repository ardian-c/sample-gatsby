That&#8217;s High Ride, City Cycle and RedBike &#8211; and now you can find their awesome instructors on your Stryde bike. What&#8217;s cool is that all three are great, but all different. Megan&#8217;s team at High Ride does beat-based choreography, a real dance on the bike where you have so much fun moving in and out of the saddle that you only realize that you are completely spent when the lights come on and the music stops. Lauren and her crew at CityCycle &#8211; amazing classic rhythm workouts. And RedBike brings what you would inspect from top studio in Miami &#8211; instructors to burn you with their beats and looks. Oh, and upper arm sections that leave us completely spent. Congratulations to all three on well deserved recognition!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, more bikes have landed in the States, you can now find them at High Ride, Ride House and City Cycle. If you find yourselves at Denver, Dallas or Seattle &#8211; please check them out in person!</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Katana Fitnes Site"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"efc0b6ef-25b4-5920-b866-294f1fdf9082"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}

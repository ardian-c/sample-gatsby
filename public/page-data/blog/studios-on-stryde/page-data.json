When we were looking for partner studios for Stryde, we of course wanted to join hands with awesome instructor teams who will give our riders a heart-pumping fun class experience. But what we also love about boutique studios are the variations between them. The different playlists, the lights, the personalities of instructors, and, perhaps most importantly, the riding styles for each studio. While riders at home have been mostly been exposed to metric-heavy method where instructor calls out the recommended metric ranges in each phase of the ride, there&#8217;s much more variety our there &#8211; and the studios on Stryde are unique each in their own way. To learn more about what makes riding with each of the studios special, please check out their pages on Stryde site and their Instagram accounts!</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Katana Fitnes Site"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"5bab1c7e-1e79-5d5e-8b40-02031fb8518f"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}

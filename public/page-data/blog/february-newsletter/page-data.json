We hope you are all healthy and well.</strong><br>As many of you may already know, this Black History Month, Stryde has invited our community to remember, acknowledge and honor the energy and meaning behind this month. We’re encouraging you to join the celebration around the black community and culture through music and movement while taking time to amplify black artists and voices with each of the Black History Month rides that are hosted on the Stryde app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For every unique rider to take a Black History Month class on the app, Stryde will be donating $5 to <a class=\"\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://katanafit.lt.acemlnc.com/Prod/link-tracker?notrack=1&amp;notrack=1&amp;redirectUrl=aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZ0aGVsb3ZlbGFuZGZvdW5kYXRpb24ub3JnJTJG&amp;a=610376336&amp;account=katanafit%2Eactivehosted%2Ecom&amp;email=LRRV6glqIfcVPcYsJBrMHi%2FZD%2BmsUFpJrc5fHf6IoVE%3D&amp;s=bad97c655476f96a390a72c05a742011&amp;i=85A116A6A2780\" target=\"_blank\">The Loveland Foundation</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Loveland Foundation brings opportunity and healing to communities of color, especially to Black women and girls.

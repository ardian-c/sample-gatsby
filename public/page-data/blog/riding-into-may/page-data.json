We have improved the way classes are displayed to make finding your favorite and newest rides easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8211; We’ve added brand new THEME RIDES! Thank you for all the new theme ride suggestions, we have many more dropping, including a few later today!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>-We&#8217;ve also added a workout history function on the web app, so you can see how awesome you’ve been. Coming soon, a way to tell which rides have a weights section.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and one more thing.

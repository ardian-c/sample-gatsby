            "Ride with High Ride - voted as the best fitness studio in Denver by ClassPass in 2019! At High Ride, we ride to the beat of the music while also cuing metrics like cadence and resistance.",
            "We have developed our own signature ride, the High Ride, a combination of high-intensity cycling, isolated strength training & beat-based choreography. We incorporate different movements with each class, including push-ups, tap backs, side-to-sides, and four corners (and much more!) to isolate and strengthen specific muscle groups for a full body workout. In our rides you will hear a wide range of music - from latest pop hits to 80s to theme rides like British Invasion.",
            "What sets our souls on fire is being able to share our rides with you, and bringing our boutique studio experience to the homes (and hearts) of America."
